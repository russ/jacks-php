I am Jack's PHP framework.

Jack's PHP came out of a project for a client that needs a slightly complex website
that required PHP4 to run. Looking for a small framwork that stayed out of the way
was fruitless. So Jack's PHP came together over the course of a couple of days. It's
been receiving some care since then.

Features:
* Works on PHP4 (if that really is a feature).
* Small footprint, under 2K lines of code.
* Stays out of your way.

See http://jacks.bashme.org for more information.

===================================================================================

Notes:

There is a test folder in the root directory of the application. Jack's PHP doesn't
provide any testing tools at the moment (probably won't ever). Use something like
PHPUnit or SimpleTest if you want to attempt unit testing with PHP.
